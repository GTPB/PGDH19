# GTPB Course Pages



## Usage Instructions

1. Create contents using .md files in the pages folder. Use normal markdown format for your page contents.
2. The [index.md](./index.md) page is the homepage for the website. Customise it as you would create a README.md file.
3. If using pdf or images upload them to the assets folder.
4. DO NOT erase or mess with any of the other folders and/or files without consulting with the organisation, as they are necessary for the website structure, layout and integrity.

SPECIAL NOTE: When creating links to .md files within this project replace .md by .html

## Deployment instructions

1. Edit the config.yml file to change the course name and url link.
2. When ready, copy the contents in the master branch to the gh-pages branch.
3. Make sure everything works properly and do your final corrections.
