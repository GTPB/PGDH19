## Exercise using R

Modify the code of the script [R_script_Genetic_Drift_Basic.R](../src/R/R_script_Genetic_Drift_Basic.R) to:
* Make any number of runs rather than just one (hint: youâ€™ll need to add a loop and modify at least one object)
* Account for different starting values of the allele frequencies, with one new variable.
* Plot the results while the drift is simulated.
* Plot 4 figures using different stating values and different colors. Hint: use the *par()* function.
* Can you now do it for a multi-allelic locus ?
