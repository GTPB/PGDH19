## Day #1. The basics of inference in population genetics: Wright Fisher and the coalescent

### SUMMARY
* Introduced the WF model
* Coalescent : probabilistic model
* Simulations with ms
* Introduction to R
* Coalescent simulations and tree visualization with R

### QUESTION
If you had genetic data from many independent markers, would you be able to determine whether they were generated by

* A stationary population?
* A bottlenecked population?
* A growing population?

 What question would be important to ask to answer that?
